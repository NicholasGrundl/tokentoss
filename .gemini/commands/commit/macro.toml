You are performing a Macro Commit.
I have prepared the context and staged all pending files.

!{bash .gemini/hooks/macro-commit.sh --context --force}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Review the "Session Data" above, including micro-commits and the cumulative diff.
2. Generate a comprehensive git commit message that summarizes the session.
   - Use the Conventional Commits format (type(scope): description).
   - Include a body that tells the "story" of the development session (challenges, fixes, iterations).
3. Use the `run_shell_command` tool to execute the commit:
   `git commit -m "[MACRO] <your_generated_message>"`

Do NOT ask for confirmation. Just generate the message and run the command.
